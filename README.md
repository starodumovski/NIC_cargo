## Automated Process of Loading the Cargo

The main **project idea** is to present the algorithm for the demo-presentation which will be able to find approximately accurate way to load the car with given goods (cargo). The algorithm itself is described in **Project Report** (submitted one educational platform of the course).

The main algorithm is an evolutionary one, namely Genetic Algorithm, which will have such repeated:
1. Generate Population of Individuals
2. During each evolution step:
  - apply crossover
  - apply mutation to the individuals
  - kill worst Individuals
3. Calculate the final fitness of the best reached Individual
